-- Adam Osika has seperated goal counts because he changed teams halfway through.
-- I'm updating the dataset to have his goals from both team, add up to show his total goals on one row.

use 2019stats;
select player_name, goals, sum(goals)
from 2019_stats
where player_name = "Adam Osika";
-- select * from 2019_stats;
-- update 2019_stats
-- set goals = sum(goals)
-- where player_name = "Adam Osika"
